# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making. It involves the complete data analysis workflow — from data collection and cleaning to visualization and reporting.

## Objectives
- Understand the dataset and define key questions.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Clean and preprocess raw data for reliability.
- Apply statistical techniques and/or machine learning models.
- Visualize results with clear and interpretable charts.
- Summarize insights and recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy) / R (dplyr, tidyr)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly / ggplot2
- Data Handling: SQL, Excel, CSV, JSON
- Optional: Jupyter Notebook / R Markdown for reproducibility

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/username/data-analysis-project.git
cd data-analysis-project

### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the Analysis
- Open notebooks/EDA.ipynb for exploratory analysis.
- Run scripts/cleaning.py to preprocess data.
- Check results in the results/ folder.

## Key Steps in Analysis
1. Data Collection: Load dataset from CSV/API/Database.
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and formatting.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries, correlation, and distribution analysis.
4. Visualization: Bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, etc.
5. Modeling (Optional): Regression, classification, or clustering.
6. Insights & Reporting: Summarize findings with actionable insights.

## Example Visualizations
(Add some plots here after running your analysis, e.g. results/plot.png)

## Outcomes
- Identified key trends and patterns in the dataset.
- Built visualizations for better understanding.
- Derived insights that can help in decision-making.

## Future Work
- Add predictive modeling.
- Automate ETL pipelines.
- Deploy dashboards using Streamlit/Power BI/Tableau.
